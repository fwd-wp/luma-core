TODO:
customizer - FIX overlay opacity - not saving properly, also not retrieving default
Customizer - auto update on post excerpt length - also setting not working
theme.json check core and custom radius settings, merge to core and update styles in theme.json and scss


fix masonry preview

                - need to create js for reset buttons in typography
                - customize full list view and single view (same html)
                       - consider moving /content to /content-single, with conditional author bio
                - look into custom search result format (modify list archive view)
                - add categories to archive views, also is_sticky (featured post);
        
                - look into navbar breakpoint, should this be a customizer setting?
- check comments for button - styling inconsitent with block button
  

yoast support -> logo and social icons/links (could logo be utlised somewhere? maybe not?)

Verse block not displaying correctly in editor view - padding is out of whack
Cover block could be better!
fix up buttons, mixin?
separator - need full width? isStyleWide? how to set?

prefix all customizer settings

search for: font-size-h1 - possibly replace with mixin, or new variables
check wp theme.json api for other font settings (and other settings) that can be applied

fix up color swatches for customizer - seems difficult?
fix up fonts - not loading or previewing
what other customizer features can be added?
colors - primary, secondary, ternary?
for colors pick from these three or custom? colors - heading, text, border??
look into which block patterns and styles can be removed (due to redundancy)
add php tests
look into bootstrap rfs for dynamic resizing of css elements https://github.com/twbs/rfs



Improvements: 
- All procedural code moved into classes
- Functions moved into static functions inside function classes
- removed all IE polyfill js/css
- removed dark mode support (to simplify this starter theme)
- removed responsive embed js code (this can be achieved with css in modern browsers)
- added <div class="entry-body"> to pages, and moved thumbnail inside it for easier styling
- moved entry-header's to a TemplateTag function
- moved page-header's to a TemplateTag function


search and replate (case sensitive)

'luma-core'-> 'luma-core' - text domain (must do this first)
            -> 'luma-core-   - js and block namespaces
Twenty-One -> Luma-Core - Block Category label

twenty_one -> luma_core_ - php variables
Twenty\One -> Luma\Core - php namespace
twentytwentyone - lumaCore - js function namespace



post front page site title h1, posts h2
blog page, if static front page, page title h1, posts h2
archive page - archive heading is h1, posts h2, post subheading h3
single post page - post heading h1, post subheading h3???
page - page title h1, sub headings h2

only issue is post subheadings are h3, page subheadings are h2. 
what about when a post is displayed singularly? subheadings are now h3 instead of h2!!
paginated blog front page, theres no H1 !!
